# Hi there 👋

My name is Robin Gruyters and live in the Netherlands. Working now as a DevOps and Platform Engineer at @suecodelabs.

In my spare time I like to go to festivals and spent my time with friends and family.

Like to:

- tinker in my [Neovim configuration](https://github.com/rgruyters/nvim)
- program in Python and Go
- find 🐛 and solve problems

Current goals for 2025:

- learn more by giving my 2¢ to open source
- learn a new programming language (rust or zig)
- write more on [my blog](https://nieuweavonturenvan.nl)
